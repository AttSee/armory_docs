# Debug

Click `Armory Project - Kode Studio` to open the bundled integrated development environment. Kode Studio is based on Visual Studio Code and comes preconfigured for Kha-based projects.

Armory project can be launched directly from Kode Studio by pressing `F5`. Kode Studio contains debug support for Krom and lets you place breakpoints.

When compiling to one of the C++ targets, native project files are generated. This makes it easy to debug and profile Armory projects in Visual Studio or XCode IDE.

For graphics debugging, check out [RenderDoc](https://armory3d.org/manual/#/tooling/renderdoc).
