Please consider reading through this manual before purchasing preview. The main limitations are:

- Limited material nodes support
- Limited documentation
- Limited open world streaming
- Limited set of logic nodes implemented
- Graphical effects require more tweaking
- Animation system needs more work
- UI system needs more work
- Likely breaking backward compatibility

To reach the first release, all of these issues need to get resolved.
