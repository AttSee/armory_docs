Armory is not production ready yet - please consider reading through this manual before you start. The main limitations are:

- Engine needs more work
- Limited documentation and bugs
- Potentially breaking backward compatibility

We are always looking for more feedback - please do let us know about the issues you are facing at [GitHub](https://github.com/armory3d/armory/issues).
