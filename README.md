# Welcome

![](getting_started/img/intro.jpg)

Please consider reading through this manual before purchasing preview. The main limitations are:

- Limited material nodes support
- No open world data streaming
- Minimal docs / API functionality out of the box
- Graphical effects require more tweaking
- Limited Python / JS support
- Very few logic nodes implemented
- Likely breaking backward compatibility

To reach the first release, all of these issues need to get resolved.
