Resulting files will be located at *your_blend_file_location/build/html5*. Note that you need to copy these files to a web server or start a local server. Otherwise you will get a cross-origin error when opening index.html directly due to security reasons of web browsers. When starting HTML5 project from Blender, Armory starts a local server automatically.
